# PSVR2 Play Area Setup

This is a utility designed for the PlayStation VR2 on PC. It interfaces directly with the SteamVR driver. No PSVR2Toolkit needed! It's still pretty rough, so there's still more work to do with refining this when it comes to UI/UX or even some technical parts with camera positions/calibration.

## Features
- Stereo passthrough with floor projection
- Add and subtract drawing
- Point move and delete
- Clear SLAM map (use this if you have tracking issues but want to preserve your play area)
